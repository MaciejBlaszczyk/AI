# Artificial Neural Networks

# NeuralNetwork02: 

Simple linear neural network which contains 3 neurons, 5 inputs and 1 output each.

It tries to recognize whether animal is a mammal, a fish or a bird.

Input features are : 

- number of legs

- does animal live in water?

- can animal fly?

- has animal feathers?

- does animal lay eggs?

# NeuralNetwork03:

Simple linear neural network built from 1 neuron with 5 inputs and 1 output.

We are trying to teach it to recognize specified elements.

Program shows step by step how error is decreasing during learning.

# NeuralNetwork04:

Similar network to 03 one, but with 3 neurons, 5 inputs and 3 outputs each.

# NeuralNetwork06:

Simple non-linear neural network which consists of 1 neuron with 2 inputs and 1 output (-1 or 1).

It shows graphically on 2 dimension (2 inputs) surface how network behaves during teaching.

# NeuralNetwork08:

Non-linear neural network built form 2 layers(1 hidden) with 2 neurons each and 2 bias-neurons.

Backpropagation algorithm used for transferring errors and sigmoid function as an activation function.

Network has 2 inputs, 2 outputs and tries to recognize whether the 1st input has negative or positive value. 

If there is negaitve value : 1st output = 0     2nd output = 1

If there is positive value : 1st output = 1     2nd output = 0
