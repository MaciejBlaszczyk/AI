# NeuralNetwork02: 

Simple linear neural network which contains 3 neurons, 5 inputs and 1 output each.

It tries to recognize whether animal is a mammal, a fish or a bird.

Input features are : 

- number of legs

- does animal live in water?

- can animal fly?

- has animal feathers?

- does animal lay eggs?

# NeuralNetwork03:

Simple linear neural network built from 1 neuron with 5 inputs and 1 output.

We are trying to teach it to recognize specified elements.

Program shows step by step how error is decreasing during learning.

# NeuralNetwork04:

Similar network to 03 one, but with 3 neurons, 5 inputs and 3 outputs each.

# NeuralNetwork06:

Simple non-linear neural network which consists of 1 neuron with 2 inputs and 1 output (-1 or 1).

It shows graphically on 2 dimension (2 inputs) surface how network behaves during teaching.

# NeuralNetwork08:

Non-linear neural network built form 2 layers(1 hidden) with 2 neurons each and 2 bias-neurons.

Backpropagation algorithm used for transferring errors and sigmoid function as an activation function.

Network has 2 inputs, 2 outputs and tries to recognize whether the 1st input has negative or positive value. 

If there is negaitve value : 1st output = 0     2nd output = 1

If there is positive value : 1st output = 1     2nd output = 0

# LinearGradientDescent

Simple linear gradient descent algorithm.

# CurseOfDimensionality1

We have a hyperball with a radius equal to 1.0 inscribed inside a hypercube with edges length equal to 2.0.
We randomly fill the hypercube with evenly distributed points. What % of those points would be inside the hyperball, and what % outside in the corners?

# CurseOfDimensionality2

We have a hypercube with edges length equal to 1.0. We randomly fill it with evenly distributed points.
What is the ratio between the standard deviation of distance between those points and the average distance between them?

# KNN

The task is to prepare 4 plots showing how given areas of space would be classified by the following variants of k-NN:
* Euclidean distance,  k=1;
* Euclidean distance, k=5;
* Mahalanobis distance, k=1;
* Mahalanobis distance, k=5;
