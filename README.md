#NeuralNetwork02: 

Simple linear neural network which contains 3 neurons, 5 inputs and 1 output each.

It tries to recognize whether animal is a mammal, a fish or a bird.

Input features are : 

- number of legs

- does animal live in water?

- can animal fly?

- has animal feathers?

- does animal lay eggs?

#NeuralNetwork03:

Simple linear neural network built from 1 neuron with 5 inputs and 1 output.

We are trying to teach it to recognize specified elements.

Program shows step by step how error is decreasing during learning.

#NeuralNetwork04:

Similar network to 03 one, but with 3 neurons, 5 inputs and 3 outputs each.

#NeuralNetwork06:

Simple non-linear neural network which consists of 1 neuron with 2 inputs and 1 output (-1 or 1).

It shows graphically on 2 dimension (2 inputs) surface how network behaves during teaching.
